So this is how my poker game works:

The user inputs the number of players desired (must be at least 2) and then every user inputs their name (names must be distinct).

Then the cards are dealt and the game decides on the winner(s) based on high card rules. The game then prints what each player had and who the winner(s) is. 

Finally the user inputs whether they want to play another hand.
