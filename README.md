# ix-lisbon-project-week-1

So this is how my poker game works:

The user inputs the number of players desired (must be at least 2) and then every user inputs their name (names must be distinct).

Then the cards are dealt and the game decides on the winner(s) based on high card rules. The game then prints what each player had and who the winner(s) is. 

Finally the user inputs whether they want to play another hand.

Also, here is a link to my blog:

Blog is live, poker game executes, nice touch with asking to play another hand but watch out because after more than one hand Aces, Kings etc. revert back to being represented as 14, 13 etc.

README just needed to be a bit more in depth in explaining if you used classes/how the inner workings of your poker_game.py file worked.
